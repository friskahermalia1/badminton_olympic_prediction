# **Cash, Court, and Champions: The Olympic Badminton Connection**

The Olympics is the largest multi-event competition in the world, designed to showcase the achievements of athletes. Participating in this great event is a matter of pride, especially if the athlete can bring home a medal for his or her country. Badminton has become one of the most popular and competitive sports in the world. Originating from the game of shuttlecock, badminton was introduced to the Olympic Games in 1992 and has since become an important part of the Summer Games, showcasing remarkable skill, agility and strategy.

The Olympic badminton court is not only a stage for showcasing individual talent, but also a reflection of greater economic and cultural factors. As with other Olympic sports, the success of badminton athletes is influenced by several elements beyond just athletic ability. Financial investment in training facilities, coaching and athlete support plays a critical role in shaping performance outcomes. In addition, support from national sports organizations and government incentives can have a significant impact on a country's success in the sport.

The connection with badminton is deeply personal and resonates with national pride for many people, including myself. Watching Olympic badminton has not only been a source of inspiration, but has also highlighted the complex interplay between business and sport. This personal interest has motivated me to take a closer look at how financial and economic factors influence the success of badminton players on the Olympic stage.

In this project, I aim to explore the following key questions:
1. How does the GDP per capita of a country correlate with the success of its badminton athletes in the Olympic Games?
2. How does the Population of a country correlate with the success of its badminton athletes in the Olympic Games?
